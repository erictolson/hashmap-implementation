# hashmap-implementation

This repository contains two .py files that include classes and methods necessary to implement a Hash Map ADT in two different forms. hash_map_oa.py utilizes open addressing to handle collisions, while hash_map_sc.py utilizes seperate chaining. This repository also contains a file, a6_include.py, which contains dynamic array and singly linked list classes that are imported into the other two files.
